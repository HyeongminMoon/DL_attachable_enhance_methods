# DL_attachable_enhance_methods
Deep Learning attachable method to enhance model in my subjective. (Growing!ðŸ˜‡)


## Training - model centric
- basic methods(drop out, weight decay, batch normalization) 
- An inverse relationship between batch size & learning late (relative link)
- Fixing the train-test resolution discrepancy(FixRes) (paper link) (repository link) (subjective readme link)
- Cosine Annealing 
- 

## Training - data centric
- Augmentations (subjective readme link: opencv, etc)
- 

## Inference(Test)

## optimization & lightening
- Quantization with tflite (tflite doc link)
- TensorRT(TensorRT link)
- Convert to Onnx(Onnx link)

## code side enhancement
- pytorch lightening
- pytorch geometric
